# Monitoring-Emails-for-Keyword-Detection-in-Real-Time
README
Overview
The Email-Based Access Authentication System is a Python-based project that uses email communication for remote access authorization. It allows real-time monitoring of incoming emails for user responses and grants or denies access based on keywords ("Accept" or "Deny") in the email subject or body.

Features
Send automated emails to notify users about access requests.
Monitor incoming emails for responses in real time.
Parse email content and identify authorization commands.
Provide immediate feedback on access control decisions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
smtplib: For sending emails.
imaplib: For accessing and monitoring email inbox.
email: For parsing email content.
datetime: For time-related operations.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:

A Gmail account for sending and receiving emails.
Enable "Allow less secure apps" in your Gmail settings (if required).
Python 3 installed on your system.
Install Required Libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install smtplib
pip install imaplib
Configure Email Credentials:

Update the following in the script:
python
Copy code
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
sender_password = "your_app_password"
recipient_email = "recipient_email@gmail.com"
IMAP_SERVER = "imap.gmail.com"
Run the Script:

Execute the script to start sending emails and monitoring responses:
bash
Copy code
python email_access_authentication.py
How It Works
The system sends an automated email to the recipient, requesting access confirmation.
The recipient replies with either "Accept" or "Deny" in the subject or body of the email.
The script monitors the inbox for new responses in real time.
Based on the keyword in the email, access is either granted or denied.
Code Highlights
Email Sending: Utilizes smtplib to send an email with a subject and body.
Email Monitoring: Uses imaplib to access the Gmail inbox and parse emails for keywords.
Real-Time Decision: Analyzes the subject and body of incoming emails for predefined commands.
Example Scenarios
Use Case 1: An unknown transaction attempt is made using a card. The system notifies the cardholder and waits for their confirmation.
Use Case 2: Remote access control where the user approves or denies entry through an email response.
